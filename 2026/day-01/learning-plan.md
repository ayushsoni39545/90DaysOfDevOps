I am a working professional at Infosys with 4 years of experience, where I worked as a support engineer on multiple projects.
I have a decent understanding of cloud technologies, particularly Azure.
I want to learn DevOps to enhance my skills and secure a better position in the company.
My goal is to reach a stage where I don’t have to worry about job security based on my skill set.
I will try to be consistent every day by cutting down my social media time and dedicating it to learning.
I am allocating 1–2 hours daily, or if not possible, 2–3 hours on alternate days.
